            "I worked on a Battle Royale/MOBA game called 'Hit and Boom' using Unreal Engine. Throughout the project, I actively contributed to various aspects, including gameplay, AI, and UI. My primary focus was on player abilities, where I was involved in developing new abilities and addressing bugs. Additionally, I worked on UI elements and enhanced my network programming skills to accommodate the multiplayer nature of the game. <br><br> One of the key highlights of my contributions to this project was the design and programming of the game's AI, where I had the freedom to create the system from scratch. These AI characters move in teams of three while staying in the zone, clearing enemy camps, engaging in fights using skills, strategically avoiding disadvantaged situations, and surviving until reaching the final zone. The resulting work received positive feedback from both players and my colleagues.",

            "I've worked on this indie game student project with a team of more than 10 people. Except for the AI, I programmed the game all by myself. We created a playable demo in 3 months and presented it at school. Sometimes, I created systems from the ground up. Other times, I followed tutorials and significantly modified existing code to align with our game's design requirements. <br><br> Starting from scratch, developing a relatively ambitious game with many artists and designers, necessitated solving countless problems and delving into topics that were unfamiliar to me back then. I believe that I gained a lot of experience from this project. Below, you'll find detailed explanations of the game systems I've programmed:",

            "Interaction System: Implemented for various in-game actions, such as moving platforms, opening doors, looting items, and equipping weapons found on the ground.",
            "Climbing: Implemented ladder climbing and rock climbing (2D movement). Climbing has its own Input Mapping Context, preventing players from using other inputs such as shooting while climbing.", 
            "Rail Camera System: Developed camera tools for level designers to utilize. The camera tracks the player while moving on spline paths. Camera is customizable, it can rotate to the character, follow on the corridor axis, follow on depth axis with a desirable amount. Trigger boxes strategically positioned in the level trigger dynamic camera changes.",
            "Vaulting Climbing System: Implemented a dynamic system for vaulting and climbing, selecting the appropriate animation based on obstacle height and depth.", 
            "Dialogue System: Utilized a data table to store NPC IDs, lines, and voices. When approached to an NPC and pressed button, the UI widget appears, the camera zooms, and voice lines are played if the NPC has something to say. Dialogues are skippable. Dialogue cancels itself when moving away from NPCs.",
            "Save & Load System: When overlapped with BP_Checkpoint, it saves the player's health, location, equipment, and active camera. Upon death, the player respawns at the last checkpoint. The player can carry information between levels with this save and load system.",

Each action has its sound amount, contributing cumulatively to the total sound level displayed on the HUD. We had planned to spawn more enemies with each surpassed threshold (similar to the GTA police level).",
            "Basic Inventory System: players can collect items, drop them physically on the ground, and utilize them for effects like health boosts.", 
            "Implemented a system for opening chests, transferring items between chests and inventory, and stacking items on top of each other.",
            "Implemented narrative voice lines triggered by specific locations using trigger boxes.",

I decided to combine this inspiration with my plans to making a C++ project for my portfolio. The result is this photo mode implementation, where Iâ€™ve replicated many of the features and exact camera controls from Hellblade II. I've only implemented about half of the features because I had to stop at some point. After all, it was a challenge to prove to myself that I could do it. This project was a great way to challenge myself and showcase my capabilities. <br><br> You can download the project from GitHub to try it out.
